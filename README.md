# ETG-Inventory-Management-System-Assignment
This repository is having all the codes with json files for making an inventory management system during ETG AI/ML internship.       
I have made an inventory management system which is working on no SQL data base.                                
I have used JSON file system for it.
New items can be added to the inventory.                                      
You can add extra quantity for the existing item.
I have added the following features for each product:                            
1.Name                                               
2.Quantity                                              
3.Price                                                    
4.Manufacturing Date                                      
5.Expiry Date
6.Warranty                                                
My project can ask the user for the product id and quantity he want.If the product id exists and quantity entered is less than the existing quantity,it can generate the
bill amount and can update the inventory.                                             
My project can also show the detalis of a customer if he buys something.                                     
The details include his name and phone number.                                                   
If the product id entered by the user is not found, then my project will print a message like id not found and if entered quantity exceeds the existing quantity, 
then it will print a message like not having that much quantity.
